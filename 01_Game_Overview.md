## Krampus - The Winter's Warden
Krampus is the dark herald of winter, a being born from humanity's envy and resentment. His towering, horned figure looms in the coldest nights, seeking those he deems 'naughty' to devour. Despite his fearsome nature, a cult devoted to him rounds up victims in his name, indifferent to their innocence or guilt. This group, driven by despair and envy, aims to extinguish joy wherever they find it.

## Scrooge - The Embodiment of Greed
Scrooge, another dark entity, embodies greed and cold-heartedness. He twists minds with craven desires, turning individuals against one another in pursuit of wealth and luxury. Like Krampus, he has followers who emulate his greed, hoarding wealth and indulging in lavishness at the expense of others.

## A Tenuous Alliance
Krampus and Scrooge, despite their mutual hatred, sometimes collaborate for mutual benefit, often seen plotting to undermine the joyous spirit of Christmas. Their cults, though inherently opposed and eager to destroy each other, are occasionally forced to cooperate by their dark patrons. Yet, during these alliances, each side seeks to outmaneuver the other, reflecting the eternal struggle for dominance between their respective evil gods.
